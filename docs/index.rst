`scikit-hubness`: high-dimensional data mining
================================================

``scikit-hubness`` is a Python package for analysis of hubness
in high-dimensional data. It provides hubness reduction and
approximate nearest neighbor search via a drop-in replacement for
`sklearn.neighbors <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.neighbors>`_.
